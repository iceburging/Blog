    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally after ten years of following the development of the world-wide-web and the technologies that let us interact with it (and each other) I have established an official web presence! In all honesty I have spent years making use of other people&#8217;s blogs to guide me through many a tricky problem and I figure that perhaps now is the time to start giving something back.</p>

<p>For the five years I have focussed upon Ruby (a fantastic little language) and Rails (a powerful web-framework for Ruby) so expect this to drive the brunt of the postings. This said I am also fascinated by the human side of the web; the way we interact with websites and the psychology behind this interaction. So with any luck you may see a few things along these lines thrown in - plus the usual &#8216;interesting tech&#8217; things that pique my curiosity.</p>

<p>Anyway I think this will do to test the system; which, for those of you who may be interested, is comprised of the Ruby static site generator Jekyll, the Octopress styling framework, and Heroku the (very) Ruby friendly cloud application platform. Oh and of course Git bringing it all together.</p>
